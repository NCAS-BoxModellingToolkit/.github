Welcome to the NCAS-BoxModellingToolkit Organisation. A facilitator for the atmospheric science community.

The atmospheric science community motivate, develop, apply and disseminate the contained repositories. The GitHub Organisation is overseen by the [National Centre for Atmospheric Science](https://ncas.ac.uk) (NCAS (UK)). 

Single box models are spatially zero-dimensional, thereby assuming homogeneity of composition across the space being simulated.

Currently the organisation supports three box models:
* [AtChem2](https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2/tree/master)
* [INCHEM-Py](https://github.com/DrDaveShaw/INCHEM-Py/tree/main)
* [PyCHAM](https://github.com/simonom/PyCHAM/tree/master)

Users of the above models will find tools for their setup and analysis in this organisation.

To contribute, you are welcome to contact the developer for the model of interest to discuss ideas. Push requests from a forked repository will be assessed by the relevant developer and gratefully accepted if deemed helpful.

Note that README guidelines are [here](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8e6b2b5-2b4f-471c-9c1a-3375a206b6de)
